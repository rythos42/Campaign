Todo:
- UI
- don't allow multiple people with same username
- don't allow sign up with blank username/password
- better text/translation support
- secure password when sending to web service
- page campaign list
- search campaign list
    - by created by username or campaign name
- can I add stats for a particular game and stay game-system agnostic?

Goals:
- encourage people to play and log their games through gamification
- can't force playing a particular player
- try to stay game agnostic for as long as possible

Stats:
- races played
- size of game
- number of dice for each player
- scenario
    - drop down list for known scenarios
    - free input for others
        - input of "where you got it"
        
"The Game":
- X games/month scheduled with another player, or forced to be near their map edge
- up to X games/month allowed, attack anywhere on the map
- think about Eclipse as a model of how such a meta-game might work

Future:
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
- XP system
- diminishing returns on how effective each game is per week?
- randomly generated map image
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- map campaign -- can only attack nearby
    - or "support from neighbouring territories"
