Next:
- TB needs big re-work
    - Team pool
    
- if there are no FactionEntries when Finishing, it sets the OwningFactionId to empty. Should leave owner as-is.
- Map stripe colour based on AttackingUserId -- if they person leaves the attack the colouring stays the same
- If the attacking player leaves an attack, the defender is left hanging (in controlled scenario). 
    
- switch factions for a player  - drop down list in the PlayerListWidget
- Create Campaign is left aligned weirdly
- Create Campaign Map bigger than necessary
- clear the map when moving between campaigns - looks weird to have the old map still up

- should we restrict users to only one outstanding attacking at a time?

Run @ home:
    alter table User add column OneSignalUserId char(36)
    create table AuthorizationToken (
        Id int not null AUTO_INCREMENT,
        HashedToken char(64) not null,
        UserId int not null,
        Expires datetime not null,
        primary key (Id),
        foreign key AuthorizationToken_User (UserId) references User(Id)
    ) 
    
Future:
- consider map library for maps http://leafletjs.com/
        
Before a general release:
- "Contact us"
- Account recovery, since we mention it on the e-mail thing.
    - after doing account recovery, update password storing scheme and reset all passwords in the system
    - make sure all users have e-mails set up    
        $stored = password_hash(base64_encode(hash('sha256', $_POST['password'], true)), PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
        if (password_verify(base64_encode(hash('sha256', $_POST['password'], true)), $stored)) { // Success :D } else { // Failure :( }
        "Won't truncate at 72 characters and is fully binary-safe, so early null bytes will not lead to security weaknesses."
    - or use https://github.com/paragonie/password_lock which appears to do the above.
- Facebook OpenGraph image
- In the rules document, create a new document that outlines what is "in the system" and what isn't, so admins can make their own rules.
    - each faction will need an "Admin"
    - First admin is the person who made the campaign. They become admin after joining it.
- Password changing
    - invalidate all tokens for user when changing password
- More security:
    - Limit number of attempts to login before locking.
    - Consider dummy users in database
- I am an MMO:
    - the server is the sole source of truth in the world, client can be hacked. Or even timing issues.
    - more verification on the server
    - at the very least, need to check for timing issues and report back when something isn't as expected.
    
            
Terms and Admin Help:
    - A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    - An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.
    - TerritoryBonus is a generic term for "materials" in the current UI. I didn't want to update all of the code to say "materials", in case we theme this for another settings in the future.
    - Tags can be used for any kind of information on territories - bonus', required points values, suggested terrain.
    - To insert administrative news: insert into News (News) VALUES ('Mores news');

Far Future:
- Simple defects:
    - hide Attack button for Simple until joined
    - hide map area for Simple, entirely
    - put Simple Attack button just on its own?
    - loading UI always shown on Simple campaign, because it never loads the map
    - push notifications likely sending when they shouldn't for simple
- Administrator interface:
    - delete campaigns
- Purchase buys:
    - create campaign customization: set height, width, number of sectors on map, pick background image
    - choose colours for faction
    - interface themes for you and your fellow gamers
    - allow campaign creator to try different map images and select one as the default for the campaign
    - for buying: group buy, or individual buy? Roll20: group buy, $5/month or $50/year.
- some weirdness with timing - Dan attacked 8, and it was uncontested at the time. I took 5 which made it contested.
- can I make the notification listified for multiple notifications coming in
    - on notification display event, can add to a list of notifications. Just don't know if I want to add this to the UI right now.
- consider helping user with good passwords: https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn
- can't sort dates in Entry table - stupidtable holds onto table values when it shouldn't
    - maybe make an issue https://github.com/joequery/Stupid-Table-Plugin/issues/78
- Materials on CreateEntry is for "spending", so should be more clear
- show "being attacked" on map legend
- marker for uncontrolled, non-adjacent territories that haven't been contested within 24 hours
    - this seems pretty difficult to do, so added Created On date for the dialog instead
- "just this phase" entry filter
- don't let people attack if they have an outstanding attack
    - or, ask them are you sure?
- probably could delete "AttackingUserId", as territories now have multiple attackers. It's also a complete duplicate of CreatedByUserId right now.
- star on territory with tag when creating campaign
- is there a way I can allow in-faction fighting? Since you have to click a territory to attack it doesn't super work?
- icon noting which campaigns are map and which are simple
- sweet background on header
- rename table indexes -- easier in mySQL 5.7
- page campaign list
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry to allow easier adding of multi-player games
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- Stats:
    - races played (game-specific)
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player (Antares-specific)
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
