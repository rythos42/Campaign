Now:
- a campaign entry now has to be FOR someone, so the entry can be counted AGAINST someone (or some territory)
    - if we do the player-owned territory, need to get all adjacent territories for the logged in player
    - but players attack factions, so can colour his territories in a static "first person" colour, then his allies in the ally colour and enemy in enemy colour
    - store OwningUserId instead of (or as well as) OwningFactionId.
        - my current view is that players could switch sides, but that breaks with OwningUserId
    - have to be able to mark a faction as "my faction" when entering an entry
    - if "my faction" won, then mark the territory as "owned by this player/faction"
        - what would it mean if the player marked multiple factions as "my faction"?
        - likely that an enemy faction would suddenly have a territory in the middle of what was previously all "allied"?
    

Near Future:
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- resize canvas based on browser:
        function resize_canvas(){
            canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
            if (canvas.width  < window.innerWidth) canvas.width  = window.innerWidth;
            if (canvas.height < window.innerHeight) canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
        }
        <body onresize="resize_canvas()">
- possible issue if you immediately click on a campaign you just created?
- update geeksong database so this can be used
         
Notes:
    Work:
    - TestUser/password     (no map)
    - rythos42/             (yes map)
    Home:
    - c/c                   (no map)
    - qwer/qwer             (yes map)

        
Goals:
- encourage people to play and log their games through gamification
- can't force playing a particular player
- try to stay game agnostic for as long as possible


Future:
- page campaign list
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- XP system
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- factions can choose colours

Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
