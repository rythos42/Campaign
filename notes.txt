Next:
    - hide Attack button for Simple until joined
    - hide map area for Simple, entirely
    - put Simple Attack button just on its own?
    - when creator joins campaign, make that person admin
    - login weird -- if you press "enter" on Username/password while on registration page, it says "Username/password not correct"
    - loading UI always shown on Simple campaign, because it never loads the map
    - show TerritoryBeingAttackIdOnMap, Finished, Winner in entries
    - font for "Spend 1 Material" is wrong
    - "delete entry" button for users
    - don't allow Finishing territories adjacent to another faction without multiple people in the entry (ie, you can't take territory adjacent without contesting)
   
    
    
    I think I want to make 3 changes:
(1) Rules change: A person can only Attack once every 24 hours. There's no reason someone should be able to attack even twice in a single day, and this will prevent one team from taking the entire board because they happened to all be sitting at their PCs.
(2) System change: Cannot Finish a territory that is controlled, or adjacent to a controlled territory, until there are 2 players in the entry. 
(3) Systme change: As you say, I'll add a new colour and let people sign up to be defenders of contested territories and make it more visible.

    for #2 - allow admins to approve a territory grab in the event that no one contests the claim.
at the end of the phase the person can get the territory
it'll be like concession wins in blood bowl that way

--I'll wait before I click finish.  The " victory points" and " materials used" should have something in them?
            
Before a general release:
- "Contact us"
- Account recovery, since we mention it on the e-mail thing.
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy? 
    Roll20: group buy, $5/month or $50/year.

Terms and Admin Help:
    - A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    - An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.
    - TerritoryBonus is a generic term for "materials" in the current UI. I didn't want to update all of the code to say "materials", in case we theme this for another settings in the future.
    - Tags can be used for any kind of information on territories - bonus', required points values, suggested terrain.
    - To insert administrative news: insert into News (News) VALUES ('Mores news');

Far Future:
- Administrator interface:
    - delete campaigns
- Campaign Administrator interface:
    - switch factions for a player  - drop down list in the PlayerListWidget
- Purchase buys:
    - create campaign customization: set height, width, number of sectors on map, pick background image
    - choose colours for faction
    - interface themes for you and your fellow gamers
    - allow campaign creator to try different map images and select one as the default for the campaign
- might be able to get rid of TerritoryDetailsDialog
- star on territory with tag when creating campaign
- is there a way I can allow in-faction fighting? Since you have to click a territory to attack it doesn't super work?
- icon noting which campaigns are map and which are simple
- sweet background on header
- Attacks a computed value? We can calculate it once we have Phases - it's the number of times that player was an Attacker in that Phase.
- rename table indexes -- easier in mySQL 5.7
- page campaign list
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry to allow easier adding of multi-player games
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- Stats:
    - races played (game-specific)
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player (Antares-specific)
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
