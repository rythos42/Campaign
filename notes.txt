Now:
- validate that a territory has been selected
- resize canvas based on browser:
        function resize_canvas(){
            canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
            if (canvas.width  < window.innerWidth) canvas.width  = window.innerWidth;
            if (canvas.height < window.innerHeight) canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
        }
        <body onresize="resize_canvas()">
- map is hard to read at this size
- "get territories" function currently returns all territories adjacent to all factions
    - maybe this should take a factionId? Would have to wait until user enters his faction for that. :(

- if we do the player-owned territory, need to get all adjacent territories for the logged in player
    - but players attack factions, so can colour his territories in a static "first person" colour, then his allies in the ally colour and enemy in enemy colour
    - store OwningUserId instead of (or as well as) OwningFactionId.
        - my current view is that players could switch sides, but that breaks with OwningUserId
- what would it mean if the player marked multiple factions as "my faction"?
    - likely that an enemy faction would suddenly have a territory in the middle of what was previously all "allied"?
- some way to place factions initially on campaign creation

Near Future:
- install kdiff at home...
- rename database stuff:
    CampaignEntry -> Entry
    CampaignFactionEntry -> FactionEntry
    CampaignFaction -> Faction
    Polygon -> Territory
    PolygonPoints -> TerritoryPolygonPoints?
- collate db changes for ease of future deployment
- update geeksong database so this can be used
- regression test everything

         
Notes:
    Work:
    - TestUser/password     (no map)
    - rythos42/             (yes map)
    Home:
    - c/c                   (no map)
    - qwer/qwer             (yes map)

Future:
- maybe a custom binder to do "keypressACTION" instead of copying this code around
- "..." progress indicator while loading map
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- page campaign list
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- XP system
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- factions can choose colours

Terms:
    A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.

Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
