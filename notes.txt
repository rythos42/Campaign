In theory, fixed race condition that was sometimes causing attacking user to not be loaded by Entry.js
Can now "back" from InProgressCampaign
Fixed "Add User" label on create campaign which should have read "Add Faction"
Creator no longer auto-joins a created campaign.
Fixed defect when navigation away from one campaign and into another.
Removed faction legend for Simple campaigns.
Made Simple campaign work.
Added "More/Less" buttons for news items that are much much larger than 150 characters
Put a scrollbar on the menu.
Sidebar closes when you log out.

Next:
    - is there a way I can allow in-faction fighting? Since you have to click a territory to attack it doesn't super work?
    - page news list, or infinite scroll or something
    
Future:
        
Before a general release:
- "Contact us"
- remove code that automatically gives permission to create map campaigns
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- promotion to allow creation of map campaigns by everyone
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy? 
    Roll20: group buy, $5/month or $50/year.

Terms and Admin Help:
    - A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    - An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.
    - TerritoryBonus is a generic term for "materials" in the current UI. I didn't want to update all of the code to say "materials", in case we theme this for another settings in the future.
    - To insert administrative news: insert into News (News) VALUES ('Mores news');

Far Future:
- icon noting which campaigns are map and which are simple
- something to allow players to switch factions in a campaign
- sweet background on header
- factions can choose colours
- admin can rename factions in their campaign
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - little ! icon on profile until they fill in e-mail
- Attacks a computed value? We can calculate it once we have Phases - it's the number of times that player was an Attacker in that Phase.
- spend TB to attack anywhere
    - checkbox on entry map page "Attack anywhere for 1 territory bonus"
    - greyed out if the current user doesn't have 1??
        - then only current user can spend.
    - or validate after we select who the attacking user is on the next page?
- rename table indexes -- easier in mySQL 5.7
- page campaign list
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- maybe a custom binder to do "keypressACTION" instead of copying this code around
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry?
    - would allow easier adding of multi-player games
    - but if territory is player-owned, you'd still need to mark one as Attacker
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round

    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
