Made header fixed.
Moved "Available Campaigns" to sidebar
Moved "Create Campaign" to sidebar

Next:
    Run at home: 
        ALTER TABLE Entry CHANGE COLUMN AttackingFactionId AttackingFactionId INT;
        CREATE TABLE News (
            Id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
            News TEXT,
            CampaignId INT,
            EntryId INT,
            CreatedByUserId INT,
            PRIMARY KEY (Id),
            FOREIGN KEY News_Campaign (CampaignId) REFERENCES Campaign(Id),
            FOREIGN KEY News_Entry (EntryId) REFERENCES Entry(Id),
            FOREIGN KEY News_User (CreatedByUserId) REFERENCES User(Id)
        ); 
    
    Narrative/Communication
    - Front page is a scrolling news list
        - news from admins
        - any updates from campaign admin
        - latest entry score and narrative
    - Allow users to select a default campaign on InProgressCampaign
    - Button to go to their default campaign.
    - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
    
Future:
    - no scroll bar on sidebar
    - can't select new campaign while sidebar still open
    - check what happens with rest of page while menu is open and : create campaign, create entry


- sweet background on header

    
Before a general release:
- remove code that automatically gives permission to create map campaigns
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- promotion to allow creation of map campaigns by everyone
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy? 
    Roll20: group buy, $5/month or $50/year.

Terms:
    A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.
    TerritoryBonus is a generic term for "materials" in the current UI. I didn't want to update all of the code to say "materials", in case we theme this for another settings in the future.

Far Future:
- factions can choose colours
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - little ! icon on profile until they fill in e-mail
- Attacks a computed value? We can calculate it once we have Phases - it's the number of times that player was an Attacker in that Phase.
- spend TB to attack anywhere
    - checkbox on entry map page "Attack anywhere for 1 territory bonus"
    - greyed out if the current user doesn't have 1??
        - then only current user can spend.
    - or validate after we select who the attacking user is on the next page?
- rename table indexes -- easier in mySQL 5.7
- page campaign list
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- maybe a custom binder to do "keypressACTION" instead of copying this code around
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry?
    - would allow easier adding of multi-player games
    - but if territory is player-owned, you'd still need to mark one as Attacker
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round

    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
