Next:
    - allow another player to "defend" an attack from the map UI
    - need to allow saving a FactionEntry without VPs so players can sign up for a game and enter VPs later
        - this would also solve the confusion around whether to end VPs/materials when attacking
        - maybe "entry" is only for entering VPs and materials.
        - attack and defend using the map
        - so you can add yourself as an entry by clicking on the territory and clicking Attack or Defend
        - need another button for "Finish Game" or something to bring you to the entry page
    - show who is attacking a territory on the TerritoryDetailsDialog
        - show who is defending too!
        
    - "delete entry" button for users
    - allow admins to approve a territory grab in case no one contests the claim before the end of the month.
    - show "being attacked" on map legend
    - ability for admins to give TB to players

            
Before a general release:
- "Contact us"
- Account recovery, since we mention it on the e-mail thing.
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy? 
    Roll20: group buy, $5/month or $50/year.
- Facebook OpenGraph image

Future:
    - hide Attack button for Simple until joined
    - hide map area for Simple, entirely
    - put Simple Attack button just on its own?
    - when creator joins campaign, make that person admin
    - login weird -- if you press "enter" on Username/password while on registration page, it says "Username/password not correct"
    - loading UI always shown on Simple campaign, because it never loads the map
    - show TerritoryBeingAttackIdOnMap, Finished, Winner in entries
    - font for "Spend 1 Material" is wrong
    - don't allow Finishing territories owned by or adjacent to another faction without multiple people in the entry (ie, you can't take territory adjacent without contesting)
        - currently only allowing admins to Finish entries, so this idea might not survive.


Terms and Admin Help:
    - A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    - An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.
    - TerritoryBonus is a generic term for "materials" in the current UI. I didn't want to update all of the code to say "materials", in case we theme this for another settings in the future.
    - Tags can be used for any kind of information on territories - bonus', required points values, suggested terrain.
    - To insert administrative news: insert into News (News) VALUES ('Mores news');

Far Future:
- Administrator interface:
    - delete campaigns
- Campaign Administrator interface:
    - switch factions for a player  - drop down list in the PlayerListWidget
- Purchase buys:
    - create campaign customization: set height, width, number of sectors on map, pick background image
    - choose colours for faction
    - interface themes for you and your fellow gamers
    - allow campaign creator to try different map images and select one as the default for the campaign
- might be able to get rid of TerritoryDetailsDialog
- star on territory with tag when creating campaign
- is there a way I can allow in-faction fighting? Since you have to click a territory to attack it doesn't super work?
- icon noting which campaigns are map and which are simple
- sweet background on header
- Attacks a computed value? We can calculate it once we have Phases - it's the number of times that player was an Attacker in that Phase.
- rename table indexes -- easier in mySQL 5.7
- page campaign list
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry to allow easier adding of multi-player games
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- Stats:
    - races played (game-specific)
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player (Antares-specific)
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
