Now:
- campaign entries are logged against a particular location on the map, within 1 space of another that faction owns
    [{"OwningFactionId":41,"Id":8,"IdOnMap":8},{"OwningFactionId":42,"Id":29,"IdOnMap":29},{"OwningFactionId":42,"Id":33,"IdOnMap":33},{"OwningFactionId":42,"Id":35,"IdOnMap":35},{"OwningFactionId":42,"Id":37,"IdOnMap":37},{"OwningFactionId":42,"Id":41,"IdOnMap":41},{"OwningFactionId":42,"Id":42,"IdOnMap":42},{"OwningFactionId":42,"Id":45,"IdOnMap":45}]
    
- update geeksong database so this can be used
- last login date
- layer background on get instead of on create -- will allow campaigns to change their background if they want

    

Near Future:
- page campaign list
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?

    
"The Game":
There is a space map. Each faction starts with a single territory on the space map. Factions can attack any territory that is adjacent to a territory they already own.
Each week, every player can make a single Attack. That Attack can be defended by any other player, including someone on their own faction.
Winning an Attack against another faction changes the territory you attacked to be owned by your faction.
Winning an Attack against your faction gives you 1 Money.
Players may defend any number of times.
At the end of the month, factions gain Money equal to the number of territories they own.
Money may be spent by any player in the faction to give them {some bonus}.

After {x} months there is a tournament to determine the final winner. Tournament rules to be determined.
Certain territories will be designated to provide certain bonus' to a faction or player if they are owned. (to be determined)


 
 
Notes:
    Work:
    - TestUser/password     (no map)
    - rythos42/             (yes map)
    Home:
    - c/c                   (no map)
    - qwer/qwer             (yes map)

        
Goals:
- encourage people to play and log their games through gamification
- can't force playing a particular player
- try to stay game agnostic for as long as possible


Future:
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - set number of differential wins to take territory
    - distance players are able to attack from
    - pick background image
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- XP system
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- factions can choose colours

Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
