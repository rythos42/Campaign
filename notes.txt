Next:
- organize CSS
- relook at entry map screen - there I could do better UI here, I think.
- confirm dialog when Finishing entry?
- Attacks a computed value? We can calculate it once we have Phases - it's the number of times that player was an Attacker in that Phase.
    
run at home:  
use Campaign;
RENAME TABLE CampaignEntry TO Entry;
RENAME TABLE CampaignFactionEntry TO FactionEntry;
RENAME TABLE CampaignFaction TO Faction;
RENAME TABLE Polygon TO Territory;
RENAME TABLE PolygonPoint TO TerritoryPoint;

ALTER TABLE TerritoryPoint CHANGE COLUMN PolygonId TerritoryId BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;
ALTER TABLE FactionEntry CHANGE COLUMN CampaignEntryId EntryId INT NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE FactionEntry CHANGE COLUMN CampaignFactionId FactionId INT NOT NULL;
                
Future:
- regression test it all again. In a couple different browsers. Make sure to test Simple functionality.
                
    Narrative/Communication
        - Move "Available Campaigns" list to a menu.
        - Allow users to select a default campaign on InProgressCampaign
        - Button to go to their default campaign.
        - Front page is a scrolling news list
            - news from admins
            - any updates from campaign admin
            - latest entry score and narrative
        - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries


- spend TB to attack anywhere

- sweet background on header
- Not consistent about tooltips -- some are title attributes, some are jquery tooltips
- "give TB" dialog positioned weirdly when entry list really long
- read-only view of Entry when finished, rather than removing link
- when editing entry, highlight is placed a split second after showing map -- can this be done more seemlessly?
- maybe we don't need entry list after we can view individual entries after they are saved
- tooltip stays up on "give" button: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21737608/jqueryui-tooltip-on-modal-button-re-appears-on-modal-close

- remove code that automatically gives permission to create map campaigns
- factions can choose colours
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image

Terms:
    A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.

Selling Questions:
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?


Far Future:
- rename table indexes -- easier in mySQL 5.7
- page campaign list
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- maybe a custom binder to do "keypressACTION" instead of copying this code around
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry?
    - would allow easier adding of multi-player games
    - but if territory is player-owned, you'd still need to mark one as Attacker
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round

    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
