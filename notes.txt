Next:
    - it's bugging me that I have to reload the page every time. Is there a push thing I can do here?
    - not letting you login the first time
    
Future:
    - Login
        - if you press "enter" on Username/password while on registration page, it says "Username/password not correct"
        - if you enter a password, then delete it, it says "you'll need a password", which is weird since it's not for registering.
    - show "being attacked" on map legend
    - countdown to next move.
    - Materials on CreateEntry is for "spending", so should be more clear
    - doesn't look good at 1920x1080, zoomed by 125%
    - could move validations to summary tab
        
Before a general release:
- "Contact us"
- Account recovery, since we mention it on the e-mail thing.
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy? 
    Roll20: group buy, $5/month or $50/year.
- Facebook OpenGraph image
- some weirdness with timing - Dan attacked 8, and it was uncontested at the time. I took 5 which made it contested.
- In the rules document, create a new document that outlines what is "in the system" and what isn't, so admins can make their own rules.
            
Terms and Admin Help:
    - A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    - An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.
    - TerritoryBonus is a generic term for "materials" in the current UI. I didn't want to update all of the code to say "materials", in case we theme this for another settings in the future.
    - Tags can be used for any kind of information on territories - bonus', required points values, suggested terrain.
    - To insert administrative news: insert into News (News) VALUES ('Mores news');

Far Future:
- Multiple Campaigns:
    - clear the map when moving between campaigns - looks weird to have the old map still up
- Simple defects:
    - hide Attack button for Simple until joined
    - hide map area for Simple, entirely
    - put Simple Attack button just on its own?
    - loading UI always shown on Simple campaign, because it never loads the map
- Administrator interface:
    - delete campaigns
- Campaign Administrator interface:
    - switch factions for a player  - drop down list in the PlayerListWidget
- Purchase buys:
    - create campaign customization: set height, width, number of sectors on map, pick background image
    - choose colours for faction
    - interface themes for you and your fellow gamers
    - allow campaign creator to try different map images and select one as the default for the campaign
- marker for uncontrolled, non-adjacent territories that haven't been contested within 24 hours
    - this seems pretty difficult to do, so added Created On date for the dialog instead
- "just this phase" entry filter
- don't let people attack if they have an outstanding attack
    - or, ask them are you sure?
- probably could delete "AttackingUserId", as territories now have multiple attackers. It's also a complete duplicate of CreatedByUserId right now.
- might be able to get rid of TerritoryDetailsDialog
- star on territory with tag when creating campaign
- is there a way I can allow in-faction fighting? Since you have to click a territory to attack it doesn't super work?
- icon noting which campaigns are map and which are simple
- sweet background on header
- rename table indexes -- easier in mySQL 5.7
- page campaign list
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry to allow easier adding of multi-player games
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- Stats:
    - races played (game-specific)
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player (Antares-specific)
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
