Now:
- Only show map-campaign option if user has correct flag in db
    - need to correctly load permissions when loading user from cookie
- For a map campaign, generate a random map and save as file on the system with a given campaignId
- Need then to be able to mark maps with overlay colour showing who owns
- Factions are given colours


Near Future:
- page campaign list
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
    
Goals:
- encourage people to play and log their games through gamification
- can't force playing a particular player
- try to stay game agnostic for as long as possible
        
"The Game":
- points difference to take territory
- Tournament at end to determine final winner
- 1 commitment game, 2 optional per month
- "Currency" to spend on games to buy extra points
- Currency is owned by players but can be spent by faction
- Certain areas provide certain bonus, but not all.
- Attack any space within limited distance.
- Holding territory gives currency
- Click on website - "challenge issued"
 
Notes:
    - TestUser/password

Future:

- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- XP system
- diminishing returns on how effective each game is per week?
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaigns
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- factions can choose colours

Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
