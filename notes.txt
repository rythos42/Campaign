Near Future:
- page campaign list
- make sure SSL works on geeksong with this
- decide whether to take an e-mail address or disallow password reset, or make password reset trivial
    - could take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
- maximum size on tables, depending on break points
- show total points per campaign
    
Goals:
- encourage people to play and log their games through gamification
- can't force playing a particular player
- try to stay game agnostic for as long as possible
        
"The Game":
- X games/month scheduled with another player, or forced to be near their map edge
- up to X games/month allowed, attack anywhere on the map
- points difference to take territory
- 
- think about Eclipse as a model of how such a meta-game might work

Future:
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- XP system
- diminishing returns on how effective each game is per week?
- randomly generated map image
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- map campaign -- can only attack nearby
    - or "support from neighbouring territories"
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaigns
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
        
Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
