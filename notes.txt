Next:
- software license!
- don't allow dropping one faction over another (or allow it, and overwrite)
- read up on database indexes and see if it would help with PolygonPoints (for getAdjacent)  
    index X, Y and OwningFactionId
- make sure canvas events work on mobile: "press"/"click" "double press?"/"dblclick" "click and drag"/"press and drag"
- tell user they can drag those little faction buttons
- if someone calls their faction "TerritoryPolygonPoints" or "CampaignId", things get awful in CampaignService::SaveCampaign
- validate that faction names are different within a campaign
- "..." progress indicator while loading map

         
Notes:
    Work:
    - TestUser/password     (no map)
    - rythos42/             (yes map)
    Home:
    - c/c                   (no map)
    - qwer/qwer             (yes map)

Future:
- allow removing territories from faction in create campaign
- collate db changes for ease of future deployment
- if we do the player-owned territory, need to get all adjacent territories for the logged in player
    - but players attack factions, so can colour his territories in a static "first person" colour, then his allies in the ally colour and enemy in enemy colour
    - store OwningUserId instead of (or as well as) OwningFactionId.
        - my current view is that players could switch sides, but that breaks with OwningUserId
- campaign button text is centered, should be left aligned
- chop down giant campaign names, or validate they are less than a decent number of characters
- better way to check for isMapCampaign in Campaign.js
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry?
    - would allow easier adding of multi-player games
    - but if territory is player-owned, you'd still need to mark one as Attacker
- map is hard to read at mobile sizes
    - click-and-drag to pan
    - hover territory no longer works while zoomed.
    - zooming should be quicker -- save both images
- not obvious enough that "Attacker" checkbox is disabled
- maybe a custom binder to do "keypressACTION" instead of copying this code around
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- page campaign list
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- XP system
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- factions can choose colours
- rename database stuff:
    CampaignEntry -> Entry
    CampaignFactionEntry -> FactionEntry
    CampaignFaction -> Faction
    Polygon -> Territory
    PolygonPoints -> TerritoryPolygonPoints?

Terms:
    A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.

Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
