Next:
- redo max TB validation
        max: { params: ko.computed(function() {
            var user = self.selectedUser();
            return (user && user.territoryBonus) ? user.territoryBonus() : 0;
        }), message: Translation.getString('cannotSpendMoreThan') }
    
    Attacks:
        - show available number of attacks on profile page
        - show number of attacks made this phase on profile page
        - players have 1 mandatory and 2 optional
        - prevent attacking if out of attacks
        
    Phases
        - A campaign creator has to go into and hit "Next Phase" button to move to next phase.
        - On next phase:
            - attack counts are reset
            - players gain TB, allocation weighted based on how many games you played in your faction this phase
            
- should be able to enter 0 into Bonus spent field    
    
Notes:
    Work:
    - TestUser/password     (no map)
    - rythos42/             (yes map)
    Home:
    - c/c                   (no map)
    - qwer/qwer             (yes map)

Future:
- regression test it all again. In a couple different browsers.

- ensureUserDataExists? Or should put into table on user creation?
- tooltip stays up on "give" button: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21737608/jqueryui-tooltip-on-modal-button-re-appears-on-modal-close
- g'damn select boxes keep changing size in different browsers
- position "Give TB" dialog better
- spend TB to attack anywhere
- swap around entry
    - pick location
    - save
    - come back later and enter who won or lost
- make sure canvas events work on mobile: "press"/"click" "double press?"/"dblclick" "click and drag"/"press and drag"
- "LastLoginDate" is not accurate, with login cookies.
- change login page to have a dedicated "sign up" page
    - link button swaps between the two views
    - basically the same ui, but with different labels
- remove code that automatically gives permission to create map campaigns
- allow dropping one faction over another to replace it
- allow removing territories from faction in create campaign
- if we do the player-owned territory, need to get all adjacent territories for the logged in player
    - but players attack factions, so can colour his territories in a static "first person" colour, then his allies in the ally colour and enemy in enemy colour
    - store OwningUserId instead of (or as well as) OwningFactionId.
        - my current view is that players could switch sides, but that breaks with OwningUserId
- better way to check for isMapCampaign in Campaign.js
- map is hard to read at mobile sizes
    - click-and-drag to pan
    - hover territory no longer works while zoomed.
    - zooming should be quicker -- save both images
- maybe a custom binder to do "keypressACTION" instead of copying this code around
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- page campaign list
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image
- XP system
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- factions can choose colours
- rename database stuff:
    CampaignEntry -> Entry
    CampaignFactionEntry -> FactionEntry
    CampaignFaction -> Faction
    Polygon -> Territory
    PolygonPoints -> TerritoryPolygonPoints?

Terms:
    A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.

Selling Questions:
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?

        
Far future:
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry?
    - would allow easier adding of multi-player games
    - but if territory is player-owned, you'd still need to mark one as Attacker
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round


    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
