Todo:
- UI
- back buttons on Create Campaign Entry and Create Campaign        
- better text/translation support
- page campaign list
- search campaign list
    - by created by username or campaign name
- view all previous entries for a campaign

Near Future:
- make sure SSL works on geeksong with this
- better way of telling people their username has been taken

Goals:
- encourage people to play and log their games through gamification
- can't force playing a particular player
- try to stay game agnostic for as long as possible
        
"The Game":
- X games/month scheduled with another player, or forced to be near their map edge
- up to X games/month allowed, attack anywhere on the map
- think about Eclipse as a model of how such a meta-game might work


Future:
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
- XP system
- diminishing returns on how effective each game is per week?
- randomly generated map image
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- map campaign -- can only attack nearby
    - or "support from neighbouring territories"
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
    
    
Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
