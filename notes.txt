    UI pass
        Desktop
            Header
                - I kind of want some sweet background graphic here
            Create Campaign
                - that damn drop down list too wide issue
                - could use a "grouping element"
                - factions table needs padding
            Create Campaign Map
                - can't scroll because the map is giant.
                - Map could use a more notable border (unless the border is plain missing)
                - Save button is not at all visible with the map at huge size
            In Progress Campaign
                - table needs a max size
                - whole thing could use a grouping element
            Map Entry
                - map takes up too much space, can't scroll
                - needs border, maybe a ridged border or something.
            Entry
                - grouping element
                - "YOu must add at least one faction" validator shows up for no reason.
                - drop down list mis-sized
                
        Mobile 375
            - map-panel size doesn't work here -- expands off edge of screen.
            - Map Entry: can't scroll map without clicking on map and de-selecting territory
            
        Mobile 320 
            Create Campaign
                - 300px wide list to big, off screen.
            In Progress Campaign
                - Button bar to wide, "Next phase" is on the next line
                - 300px wide list to big, off screen.
                - Details tab too wide, off screen
            Entry
                - 300px wide list too big, off screen
                - button off screen
            Profile
                - 300px wide off screen
                
    - old map data bug still there?
    - Not consistent about tooltips -- some are title attributes, some are jquery tooltips
            
                


                
Future:
- regression test it all again. In a couple different browsers. Make sure to test Simple functionality.
                
    Narrative/Communication
        - Move "Available Campaigns" list to a menu.
        - Allow users to select a default campaign on InProgressCampaign
        - Button to go to their default campaign.
        - Front page is a scrolling news list
            - news from admins
            - any updates from campaign admin
            - latest entry score and narrative
        - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries


- spend TB to attack anywhere

- read-only view of Entry when finished, rather than removing link
- confirm dialog when Finishing entry?
- when editing entry, highlight is placed a split second after showing map -- can this be done more seemlessly?
- maybe we don't need entry list after we can view individual entries after they are saved
- Attacks a computed value? We can calculate it once we have Phases - it's the number of times that player was an Attacker in that Phase.
- tooltip stays up on "give" button: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21737608/jqueryui-tooltip-on-modal-button-re-appears-on-modal-close
- g'damn select boxes keep changing size in different browsers
- remove code that automatically gives permission to create map campaigns
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- page campaign list
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- factions can choose colours
- rename database stuff:
    CampaignEntry -> Entry
    CampaignFactionEntry -> FactionEntry
    CampaignFaction -> Faction
    Polygon -> Territory
    PolygonPoints -> TerritoryPolygonPoints?

Terms:
    A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.

Selling Questions:
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?

        
Far future:
- maybe a custom binder to do "keypressACTION" instead of copying this code around
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry?
    - would allow easier adding of multi-player games
    - but if territory is player-owned, you'd still need to mark one as Attacker
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round

    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
