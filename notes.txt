Now:
- map is hard to read at this size
    - click-and-drag to pan
    - hover territory no longer works while zoomed.
    
- some way to place factions initially on campaign creation

Near Future:
- make sure canvas events work on mobile: "press"/"click" "double press?"/"dblclick" "click and drag"/"press and drag"
- zooming should be quicker -- save both images
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry?
    - would allow easier adding of multi-player games
    - but if territory is player-owned, you'd still need to mark one as Attacker
- if we do the player-owned territory, need to get all adjacent territories for the logged in player
    - but players attack factions, so can colour his territories in a static "first person" colour, then his allies in the ally colour and enemy in enemy colour
    - store OwningUserId instead of (or as well as) OwningFactionId.
        - my current view is that players could switch sides, but that breaks with OwningUserId

- install kdiff at home...
- rename database stuff:
    CampaignEntry -> Entry
    CampaignFactionEntry -> FactionEntry
    CampaignFaction -> Faction
    Polygon -> Territory
    PolygonPoints -> TerritoryPolygonPoints?
- collate db changes for ease of future deployment
- update geeksong database so this can be used
- regression test everything

         
Notes:
    Work:
    - TestUser/password     (no map)
    - rythos42/             (yes map)
    Home:
    - c/c                   (no map)
    - qwer/qwer             (yes map)

Future:
- should map be displayed before an Attacker is added?
- not obvious enough that "Attacker" checkbox is disabled
- resize canvas when window changes size?
- maybe a custom binder to do "keypressACTION" instead of copying this code around
- "..." progress indicator while loading map
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- page campaign list
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- XP system
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- factions can choose colours

Terms:
    A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.

Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
