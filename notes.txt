Now:
- Need then to be able to mark maps with overlay colour showing who owns
- update geeksong database so this can be used
- last login date
    
    
- campaign entries are logged against a particular location on the map, within 1 space of another that faction owns
- territories change hands if there are 3 (differential) wins against it
- only 2 wins per person are counted for a full win per month, after that dimishing returns - 0.75 of total for each game


Near Future:
- page campaign list
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?

    
"The Game":
- Tournament at end to determine final winner
- "Currency" to spend on games to buy extra points
- Currency is owned by players but can be spent by faction
- Certain areas provide certain bonus, but not all.
- Holding territory gives currency
 
 
Notes:
    Work:
    - TestUser/password     (no map)
    - rythos42/             (yes map)
    Home:
    - c/c                   (no map)
    - qwer/qwer             (yes map)

        
Goals:
- encourage people to play and log their games through gamification
- can't force playing a particular player
- try to stay game agnostic for as long as possible


Future:
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - set number of differential wins to take territory
    - distance players are able to attack from
    - pick background image
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- XP system
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- factions can choose colours

Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
