Next:
- swap around entry
    - pick location
    - save -- able to save and come back
    - come back later and enter who won or lost
- change login page to have a dedicated "sign up" page
    - link button swaps between the two views
    - basically the same ui, but with different labels

    Mobile:
        - make sure canvas events work on mobile: "press"/"click"
        - InProgressCampaign screen is looking super shitty at < 420px
        - map is hard to read at mobile sizes
            - click-and-drag to pan
            - hover territory no longer works while zoomed.
            - zooming should be quicker -- save both images    
    
Notes:
    Work:
    - TestUser/password     (no map)
    - rythos42/             (yes map)
    Home:
    - c/c                   (no map)
    - qwer/qwer             (yes map)

Future:
- regression test it all again. In a couple different browsers.

- allow dropping one faction over another to replace it
- allow removing territories from faction in create campaign
- spend TB to attack anywhere
- better way to check for isMapCampaign in Campaign.js

- Attacks a computed value? We can calculate it once we have Phases - it's the number of times that player was an Attacker in that Phase.
- tooltip stays up on "give" button: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21737608/jqueryui-tooltip-on-modal-button-re-appears-on-modal-close
- g'damn select boxes keep changing size in different browsers
- position "Give TB" dialog better
- remove code that automatically gives permission to create map campaigns
- maybe a custom binder to do "keypressACTION" instead of copying this code around
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- page campaign list
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- factions can choose colours
- rename database stuff:
    CampaignEntry -> Entry
    CampaignFactionEntry -> FactionEntry
    CampaignFaction -> Faction
    Polygon -> Territory
    PolygonPoints -> TerritoryPolygonPoints?

    Narrative/UserCommunication
        - text writing about each entry
        - a place for that text to be prominently displayed
        - admin can write a narrative for the campaign
        - show campaign narrative
        - allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries

Terms:
    A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.

Selling Questions:
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?

        
Far future:
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry?
    - would allow easier adding of multi-player games
    - but if territory is player-owned, you'd still need to mark one as Attacker
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round


    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
