Future:
        
Before a general release:
- "Contact us"
- remove code that automatically gives permission to create map campaigns
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- promotion to allow creation of map campaigns by everyone
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy? 
    Roll20: group buy, $5/month or $50/year.

Terms and Admin Help:
    - A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    - An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.
    - TerritoryBonus is a generic term for "materials" in the current UI. I didn't want to update all of the code to say "materials", in case we theme this for another settings in the future.
    - To insert administrative news: insert into News (News) VALUES ('Mores news');

Far Future:
- is there a way I can allow in-faction fighting? Since you have to click a territory to attack it doesn't super work?
- icon noting which campaigns are map and which are simple
- something to allow players to switch factions in a campaign
- sweet background on header
- factions can choose colours
- admin can rename factions in their campaign
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - pick background image
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - little ! icon on profile until they fill in e-mail
- Attacks a computed value? We can calculate it once we have Phases - it's the number of times that player was an Attacker in that Phase.
- rename table indexes -- easier in mySQL 5.7
- page campaign list
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- maybe a custom binder to do "keypressACTION" instead of copying this code around
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry?
    - would allow easier adding of multi-player games
    - but if territory is player-owned, you'd still need to mark one as Attacker
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round

    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
