When user who created campaign joins it, they are made admin.
Trying to fix Clark's 1400px wide monitor.
Made IdOnMap an TerritoryBeingAttackIdOnMap database indexes.
Next:
    - it's bugging me that I have to reload the page every time. Is there a push thing I can do here?


Run @ work: 
ALTER TABLE Territory ADD INDEX IdOnMap_Index (IdOnMap)
ALTER TABLE Entry ADD INDEX TerritoryBeingAttackedIdOnMap_Index (TerritoryBeingAttackedIdOnMap)
    
Future:
    - login weird -- if you press "enter" on Username/password while on registration page, it says "Username/password not correct"
    - show TerritoryBeingAttackIdOnMap, Finished, Winner in entries
    - font for "Spend 1 Material" is wrong
    - show "being attacked" on map legend
    - Tab table width 100% mobile 
    - tooltip on "Played" button
    - countdown to next move.
    - clear the map when moving between campaigns - looks weird to have the old map still up
    - don't let people attack if they have an outstanding attack
    - removing everyone from a challenge -- what does this mean?
    - "You must be logged in to use this service" from NewsService GetMoreNews
    - Materials on CreateEntry is for "spending", so should be more clear
    - attacking uncontrolled territories shouldn't be able to be finished for 24 hours after creation.
    - Clark has to login every time it reloads.
    - "delete entry" button for user who created attack
        - need to think more about what this means for the campaign
        - or when all players are removed from an entry, delete it?
    - put focus on first VP on CreateEntry
    - CreateEntry validation messages are ugly
    - Make sure read-only entry still read only
        
Before a general release:
- "Contact us"
- Account recovery, since we mention it on the e-mail thing.
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy? 
    Roll20: group buy, $5/month or $50/year.
- Facebook OpenGraph image
- some weirdness with timing - Dan attacked 8, and it was uncontested at the time. I took 5 which made it contested.
- In the rules document, create a new document that outlines what is "in the system" and what isn't, so admins can make their own rules.
            
Terms and Admin Help:
    - A Campaign is something created to be played in. A Campaign contains Factions.
    - An Entry is associated with a Campaign - Campaigns will have many Entries. An Entry contains many FactionEntries, which are the standings of each Faction in the Entry.
    - TerritoryBonus is a generic term for "materials" in the current UI. I didn't want to update all of the code to say "materials", in case we theme this for another settings in the future.
    - Tags can be used for any kind of information on territories - bonus', required points values, suggested terrain.
    - To insert administrative news: insert into News (News) VALUES ('Mores news');

Far Future:
- probably could delete "AttackingUserId", as territories now have multiple attackers. It's also a complete duplicate of CreatedByUserId right now.
Simple defects:
    - hide Attack button for Simple until joined
    - hide map area for Simple, entirely
    - put Simple Attack button just on its own?
    - loading UI always shown on Simple campaign, because it never loads the map
- mobile - press on territory under the dialogs "Cancel" button closes the dialog right away!
- Administrator interface:
    - delete campaigns
- Campaign Administrator interface:
    - switch factions for a player  - drop down list in the PlayerListWidget
- Purchase buys:
    - create campaign customization: set height, width, number of sectors on map, pick background image
    - choose colours for faction
    - interface themes for you and your fellow gamers
    - allow campaign creator to try different map images and select one as the default for the campaign
- might be able to get rid of TerritoryDetailsDialog
- star on territory with tag when creating campaign
- is there a way I can allow in-faction fighting? Since you have to click a territory to attack it doesn't super work?
- icon noting which campaigns are map and which are simple
- sweet background on header
- rename table indexes -- easier in mySQL 5.7
- page campaign list
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- XP system
- consider being able to add multiple users to a FactionEntry to allow easier adding of multi-player games
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- lock in a particular army
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- Stats:
    - races played (game-specific)
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player (Antares-specific)
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
