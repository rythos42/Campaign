Now:
- allow user to click/press on a territory to select it
- last login date
- layer background on get instead of on create -- will allow campaigns to change their background if they want
- get the jquery out of MapViewModel
- update geeksong database so this can be used
    

Near Future:
- page campaign list
- take e-mail after successful login, with a note saying they won't be able to retrieval password until it's filled in.
    - means building a user profile page
- can anyone access a map campaign, and only certain people create them?
- why is the map darker in browser than in the image?
    - something in overlaying the territory markings is doing it
- resize canvas based on browser:
        function resize_canvas(){
            canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
            if (canvas.width  < window.innerWidth) canvas.width  = window.innerWidth;
            if (canvas.height < window.innerHeight) canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
        }
        <body onresize="resize_canvas()">

    
"The Game":
There is a space map of 30 territories. Each faction starts with a single territory on the space map (determined by Galactic Commissioner). Factions can attack any territory that is adjacent to a territory they already own.
{Each week}, every player can make {1} Attack. That Attack can be defended by any other player, including someone on their own faction.
{Attacker chooses how many points the game will be.}
Winning an Attack against another faction changes the territory you attacked to be owned by your faction.
Winning an Attack against your faction gives you 1 Money.
Defending an Attack against your faction gives you 1 Money
Players may defend any number of times.
{If there is a conflict about who is attacking/defending, players dice off before the game with the high roll choosing.}
At the end of the {week}, players gain Money equal to the number of territories their faction owns.
Money may be spent to give players {some bonus}. It may be gifted to other players in your own faction.
{Certain territories will be designated to provide certain bonus' to a faction or player if they are owned.{
After {x} months there is a tournament to determine the final winner. Tournament rules to be determined, but definitely take in account the territory and Money bonus
 
 
Notes:
    Work:
    - TestUser/password     (no map)
    - rythos42/             (yes map)
    Home:
    - c/c                   (no map)
    - qwer/qwer             (yes map)

        
Goals:
- encourage people to play and log their games through gamification
- can't force playing a particular player
- try to stay game agnostic for as long as possible


Future:
- create campaign customization
    - set height, width, number of sectors on map
    - set number of differential wins to take territory
    - distance players are able to attack from
    - pick background image
- for buying: group buy, or individual buy?
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
    - generate match-ups and rankings after each round
- XP system
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaign entries
- allow user to select languages if we have a list
- factions can choose colours

Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
