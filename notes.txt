Todo:
- view all previous entries for a campaign
- better text/translation support
- should not be able to save a campaign entry with no factions in it
- don't show logged in UI until login comes back true? Looks like CampaignService is being called before the user is logged in
- better UI for telling people their username has been taken
- jq autocomplete validation message when invalid selection
- clear faction entry after add faction
- clear faction entry validation after back and return
- "enter" on login page should try to login
- cursor in username (check keyboard doesn't overlap about message) (Login)
- cursor in campaign name (Campaign)
- cursor in user name (Campaign Entry)

Near Future:
- page campaign list
- make sure SSL works on geeksong with this

Goals:
- encourage people to play and log their games through gamification
- can't force playing a particular player
- try to stay game agnostic for as long as possible
        
"The Game":
- X games/month scheduled with another player, or forced to be near their map edge
- up to X games/month allowed, attack anywhere on the map
- think about Eclipse as a model of how such a meta-game might work

Future:
- tournaments, with specific people needing to be played
- XP system
- diminishing returns on how effective each game is per week?
- randomly generated map image
- text writing about each game, and a place for that text to be prominently displayed
- lock in a particular army
- scenarios can have categories of VPs in them to break it down
- admin can write a narrative for the campaign
- map campaign -- can only attack nearby
    - or "support from neighbouring territories"
- allow users to interact on the system in some way - perhaps allow comments on campaign entries
- search campaigns by the user who created them
- deadline for campaigns
        
Far future:
    Stats:
    - these would have to be game specific, is why they are far-future
    - races played
    - size of game
    - number of dice for each player
    - scenario
        - drop down list for known scenarios
        - free input for others
            - input of "where you got it"
